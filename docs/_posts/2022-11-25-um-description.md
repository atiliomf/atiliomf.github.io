Unexpected Music, or simply um, is an inspiring collection of musical tools, useful for anyone who is interested in music - from the complete beginner, seeking to undestand the fundaments of music, to the seasoned professional, striving to improve and reach the next level. 

It includes:

- A no-nonsense, fully customizable ear trainer.
- A live audio analysis tool, with which you can visualize the notes being played around you.
- A musical sketchbook, to quickly record and develop musical ideas.
- An advanced scale explorer, with hundreds of scales in various categories.
- A vast collection of chord progressions and a special interface to play them.
- A metronome, with many rhythms from around the world.
- A multi-instrument tuner, which can itself be tuned.
- An intuitive transposition function, based on shepard tones.

All of these tools are brought together by um's heart: the always visible and accessible "wheel". It lets you select notes, play melodies, explore scales, transpose, visualise and undestand the relationships between chords and much more.

Last but not least, um sounds great. You can choose among many beautifully sampled instruments or use the MIDI output if you prefer.

Some features are only available as an upgrade, but all features can be tested for free, with no commitment whatsoever.

Hopefully, um will inspire you to create some truly unexpected music!
